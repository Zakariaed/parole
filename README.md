#Emotion Recognition Using CNN and LSTM
This project implements an emotion recognition system based on audio signals using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The model classifies emotions from speech signals by processing audio files, extracting features, and applying deep learning techniques.
